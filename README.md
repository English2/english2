English 2.0
===========

Welcome to the official English 2.0 Github repository!

English 2.0 is born of a revelation that the english language is stupid.
Here, we endeavour to fix it.

The source tree contains any source code & data for any tools, keymaps, dictionaries, IME's, etc relating to the project.
Details about the language and learning material can be found in the project [wiki](https://github.com/English2/english2/wiki).

Have fun!
